# Intro-
# Hello!

My name is Hana, and I am 21 years old.

I am a Computer Science student.

I chose this major because I love mathematics and I am interested in learning more about computers and technology.

I enjoy spending my time improving my skills and learning new things, especially in areas I am interested in, such as Machine Learning.
